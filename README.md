> A curated list of awesome projects and resources related [fastai](https://docs.fast.ai)

fastai is a deep learning library which provides practitioners with high-level components that can quickly and easily provide state-of-the-art results in standard deep learning domains, and provides researchers with low-level components that can be mixed and matched to build new approaches. 

> Note: Only resources that are related to fastai v2 are presented here.
